## Welcome

This is my journey into software development, a field that I later found out I love. I intend to learn languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, Java, SQL and PHP.  
My goal is to become proficient in these languages so that I can create beautiful applications across multiple platforms. I am enrolled in a few programs that I am quite fond of thus far.   
Here's what I have planned to help me on my way: 
 1. #### Current Programs
  * [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/);
  * [PY4E](https://www.py4e.com/);
  * [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science);
  * [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

2. #### Degree/Certificates
 * I am in the process of figuring out which direction to take for accreditation.

3. #### Current stage
 * March 3 - Learning Python, JS and Intro to web deelopment;
 * March 12 - Added computer systems to my list of current duties
 

If there's anyone that will like to partner up, feel free to reach out to me. We can work together! Also, don't be afraid to identify my weaknesses. Positive criticism makes us better.
